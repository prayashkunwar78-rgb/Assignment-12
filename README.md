# Assignment 12 : JavaScript (ES6) Features
 This project is created for Assignment 12 to practice modern JavaScript (ES6+) concepts in a simple and student-level way.
 The assignment focuses on destructuring, rest and spread operators, and non-mutating array methods using clean, readable, and well-commented JavaScript code.
 The project is divided into separate files for each topic (destructuring.js, rest-spread.js, and array-methods.js) to maintain proper structure and clarity.
 A basic index.html file is used to test all JavaScript files in the browser console. 
 All examples avoid mutating original data and follow the given assignment rules, making this project suitable for learning, testing, and GitHub submission.
